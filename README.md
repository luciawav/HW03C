My thinking is straightforward, based on my analysis of the original drawing, I think it can be broken down into dispersed random lines drawn from different points, which can be viewed as dispersed line segments from the top left and right corners, the bottom left and right corners, the midpoints of the four sides and from the center. So I think if, else if is the optimal solution. After setting the random coordinates x, y and the center random coordinate, you can draw the line according to the characteristics
